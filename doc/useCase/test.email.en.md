# Test Email Sending Scenario via ChatGPT

## General Provisions

This scenario describes the process of sending a test email by a registered user through the ChatGPT interface. The main goal is to demonstrate the integration of the application with the web service `Fl64_Gpt_User_Shared_Web_Api_Test_Email` for handling such requests.

---

## Scenario Participants

1. **User**:

- A registered user with a unique PIN code and passphrase.
- Sends a request to send an email via the chat.

2. **LLM Model (ChatGPT)**:

- Processes the data provided by the user.
- Forms a request in the structure corresponding to `Fl64_Gpt_User_Shared_Web_Api_Test_Email.Request`.
- Processes the service's response and returns the result to the user.

3. **Web Service**:

- Receives the request to send an email.
- Verifies the validity of the user's data.
- Sends the email and returns the result.

## Scenario Structure

### 1. User Input Data

The user must provide the following:

- **PIN Code** (required): A unique identifier.
- **Passphrase** (required): A string used for authentication.
- **Email Subject** (optional): A string providing context for the message.
- **Email Body** (optional): The content of the email.

Example user request:

```
PIN: 1234
Passphrase: "my unique passphrase"
Subject: "Test Email"
Message: "This is a test message."
```

### 2. Request Sent by ChatGPT

The model forms a request in the following format:

```json
{
  "pin": 1234,
  "passPhrase": "my unique passphrase",
  "subject": "Test Email",
  "message": "This is a test message."
}
```

### 3. Interaction with the Web Service

The service processes the request using the following logic:

1. Authenticates the user based on `pin` and `passPhrase`.
2. Sends the email to the user's registered address.
3. Returns the operation result.

### 4. Service Response

The service response is structured as an object:

```json
{
  "instructions": "The email was successfully sent to the user. Check the user's registered email for the message.",
  "resultCode": "SUCCESS"
}
```

Possible values for `resultCode`:

- **SUCCESS**: The message was sent successfully.
- **SERVICE_ERROR**: An internal service error occurred.
- **UNAUTHENTICATED**: Invalid authentication data.

---

## Possible Errors and Handling

1. **Authentication Error (resultCode: UNAUTHENTICATED)**:

- Response to the user: "Invalid PIN or passphrase."

2. **Internal Error (resultCode: SERVICE_ERROR)**:

- Response to the user: "Failed to send the email due to a technical error."

3. **Success (resultCode: SUCCESS)**:

- Response to the user: "The email was sent successfully. Please check your inbox."
